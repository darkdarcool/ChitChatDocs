# Congratulations!

You have just learned ChitChatjs! You should never favor this over jest, because ChitChatjs works best alongside **[jest](https://jestjs.io)**! 

You can use ChitChatjs whenever and however you want for unit testing. You can use it for Advent of Code, a professional enviorment, or just you learning JavaScript.

If you need to contact ChitChatjs Devs, please go to the [github repo](https://github.com/darkdarcool/chitchat/issues) and file an issue and tell us what's wrong! We will try to help you!

If you still need some help with ChitChat, please go [here](https://github.com/darkdarcool/ChitChat/discussions/3) if you want to talk to fellow ChitChaters! 

Thanks for using ChitChat, and I'll see you later!
